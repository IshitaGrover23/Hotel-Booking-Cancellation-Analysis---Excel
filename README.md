🏨 Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis

Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of hotel booking patterns and cancellation behaviors across different guest segments and hotel types. Using Excel, I transformed raw booking data into an interactive dashboard to identify key drivers of cancellations and provide actionable insights for revenue management.

📊 Key Insights from Dashboard

Total Volume: Analyzed 119,390 total bookings with a significant 44,224 cancellations, highlighting a need for optimized retention strategies.

Segment Volatility: Couples represent the highest volume of both bookings and cancellations compared to families and single guests.

Hotel Comparison: City Hotels experience a significantly higher volume of cancellations (11,691) compared to Resort Hotels (4,054), indicating higher market volatility in urban centers.

Seasonal Trends: Bookings peak between May and June, but cancellations also see a proportional rise during these months.

Room Allocation: There is a high correlation between "Desired" room types and successful stays, whereas "Undesired" room assignments show a much lower booking volume.

🛠️ Technical Implementation

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and standardized guest categories using Excel functions.

Pivot Table Modeling: Used Pivot Tables to aggregate data across multiple dimensions (Time, Hotel Type, Guest Type).

Dynamic Dashboarding: * Implemented Slicers (Arrival Date) for interactive filtering.

Designed a custom KPI Header for immediate visibility of total metrics.

Utilized Combo Charts and Pie Charts to visualize distributions and trends.

UI/UX Design: Applied a dark-themed, high-contrast interface for a professional reporting feel.

💡 Business Recommendations

Overbooking Strategy: City Hotels should implement more aggressive overbooking or non-refundable deposit policies for peak months (May-June) due to high volatility.

Targeted Loyalty: Develop specific retention offers for "Couple" travelers, as they are the primary revenue drivers but also the most likely to cancel.

Experience Optimization: Ensure "Desired" room types are prioritized during the booking process to minimize the risk of dissatisfaction-led cancellations.
